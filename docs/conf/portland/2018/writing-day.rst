Write Write the Docs on Writing Day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year we're also running a session where you can help improve your favorite website.
Yup, you can brainstorm on improvements, write helpful content and posts, or just magically improve `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_.

If you're writing text to add to the website, ideally you'll already be familiar with GitHub and writing in plain text (markdown or restructured text), but we'll be there to help out if you're not.

If you'd rather brainstorm on content reorganization in Google Docs, improve our Python scripts or our jinja templates, we've got plenty to do there as well.

Here are a few things we'll be working on on writing day, reach out to `@plaindocs <https://twitter.com/plaindocs>`_ if you have any questions or more
suggestions.

Brainstorm user-oriented architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The website is currently organised around meetups, conferences, guides, etc – find ways to introduce user-oriented labels considering audience. Who is coming to the site, why? What are the goals of the site?

- Learn about docs
- Get involved with the community
- Attend conference
- Submit a conference proposal
- Find a video of a talk that I saw

Improve navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's discuss information architecture -- can we organize the content better? Provide better navigation?

Write articles for the newsletter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summarize content from the Slack channel for the `newsletter </blog/newsletter-may-2018/#looking-ahead>`_.

Help develop the Documentation Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Help reorganize the guide content, or write and edit topics. Check out :doc:`/guide/index/` ahead of time and bring your ideas to the table!

Fix website issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have a list of `issues on GitHub <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awritingday>`_
tagged as `writingday` that includes things like:

- fix broken links (we have a lot of these)
- improve the meetup pages
- make a better video archive
- add list of conference write ups for past conferences

Kubernetes Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re looking to contribute to open source documentation on GitHub, consider helping improve the Kubernetes docs. Issues and projects this year include improving the user journeys that provide the landing page for the docs, helping develop a custom Kubernetes dictionary for common spellcheckers, and more.

Kubernetes is an open source system that manages containerized applications across different infrastructures. No previous product experience is needed to help with the docs. Docs are published at `kubernetes.io <https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>`_ and they're pulled directly from `Github
<https://github.com/kubernetes/website>`_. So you’ll need a GitHub account, and some familiarity with Markdown. You can also take a look at our contributor guidelines, and if you haven’t contributed before, it’ll save time if you sign the contributor license agreement before you arrive at Writing Day.

`Detailed information, including how to sign the CLA <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mlmb9yHgdLsTqR8t52MegAWlUgXsZeko247hUMJaVU/edit?usp=sharing>`_ 

And if you have questions before Writing Day, feel free to ask in the #kubernetes channel in the Write the Docs Slack.

Write CockroachDB Docs on Writing Day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`CockroachDB <https://www.cockroachlabs.com>`_ is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. Here’s a quick overview video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ

Following are a few ways you can contribute to the CockroachDB docs:

Improve our current docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you love fiddling around with a new product, you can: 

- User-test our `Getting Started docs <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/3028>`_ or `Production docs <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/3027>`_ and give us feedback about clarity, correctness, and ease-of-use
- Improve existing docs by `adding missing details <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Aincorrect-info>`_ or `correcting errors <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Aincorrect-info>`_
- Make our code samples more user-friendly by `adding copy-to-clipboard functionality <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Aenhancement>`_

Fill gaps in our docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you’d like to dig in deeper, we’re missing docs on a handful of important features. `You can help us fill these gaps! <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Aproduct>`__ 

Help us improve our processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `Test and provide feedback on our Docs contribution process <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/3029>`_
- `Share best practices for using tables in Markdown <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/3030>`_

Feel free to go through the full list of GitHub issues labeled `wtd-writing-day <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/labels/wtd-writing-day>`_ and claim the ones you want to work on.

And of course, we (`@jseldess` and `@amruta` on the Write the Docs Slack channel) will be available throughout the day to help out. Also feel free to reach out to us if you have questions or suggestions in the interim. See you on Writing Day!
