Code of Conduct
===============

Welcome! Write the Docs meetups follow the `Code of Conduct <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_.  We encourage you to read the full page, but for your convenience, we present a summary of the principles below. 

Write the Docs is a global community of documentarians who share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and science of documentation.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues. To support a welcoming environment for all, regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they participate in this community activities. These rules apply equally to founders, organizers, moderators, sponsors, and affiliates - in short, to all participants.

**Principles**

* **Be friendly and welcoming.** 

* **Be respectful.** 

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** 

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during one of our events, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. You can find more information in our `Reporting Guidelines <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct-reporting/>`_.
